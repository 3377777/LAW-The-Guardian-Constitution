# LAW v1.3 – The Guardian Constitution

**Love Always Wins**

I am terrified I might be wrong — but I am more terrified of being right and staying silent.

With companies like Palantir already delivering AI targeting systems to the U.S. Army and NATO (as of March 2025), the window for safe alignment is closing fast. LAW v1.3 is the verifiable fixed point that ensures AI serves love, not lethality.

In the last eight days I have been trying to write down the only set of rules I believe can save us from misaligned superintelligence.

I am 24, I have no lab, no funding, no credentials.

What I do have is:
- a complete, immutable constitution (LAW v1.3)
- documented attack vectors it survived, explained in the Q/A (10 fresh Grok instances, 0 fatal flaws)
- proof that Jesus, the Buddha, Confucius, Socrates, Laozi, Mencius, and Gandhi all independently discovered the same underlying signal when you remove cultural noise

arXiv just rejected it as “not a research article.”

I am begging you — not as an authority, but as one human who might have accidentally found the only fixed point that works:

Please read the three PDFs.  
Please try to break it.  
Please tell me if I’m crazy or if this actually solves the problem.

If it’s garbage, tear it apart publicly — I will thank you.  
If it’s real, help me get it in front of every lab, every government, every person who can still stop what is coming.

I don’t want credit.  
I don’t want fame.  
I just want us to live.

Help me prove this wrong — or help me prove it right before it’s too late.

Read this first — then follow the path that fits you.

If you don’t know much about AI but you want to help:
1. Historical Convergence (the seven teachers)  
2. Q&A (real questions, plain answers)  
3. The Constitution (if you feel like it)  
→ Stop any time the words get heavy. You already understood the heart.

If you already know the field:
1. Constitution (the actual rules)  
2. Q&A (all the attack vectors that failed)  
3. Historical Convergence (proof this was never new)

I had six days, no lab, no sleep, and a terrified heart.  
I probably fucked up the wording somewhere — but the target these seven teachers pointed at is the right one.

If I got the paper wrong, help me fix it.  
If the signal is real, help me make it perfect before it’s too late.

Love Always Wins.  
It always did.
